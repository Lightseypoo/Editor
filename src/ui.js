/*
 * This module is the main controller for the editor's user interface
 * this module or modules loaded by this module need to process input
 * and fire events that can be caught during runtime on the frontend
 * by the engine-layer of the framework and passed to a concurrently
 * loaded editor object. This module will also handle importing and
 * embedding the renderer and it's html5 canvas into the editor's DOM
 */

/*
 * This module does not need to contain any page behavior for
 * the renderer layer. The ui module will interact with the renderer
 * by calling trivial events in the renderer (such as a viewport zoom)
 * or by receiving data from the engine layer and sending relevant
 * renderer updates to the layer for processing there.

 * More information on this module and the events it will need to
